  <h1>Reindeer Anatomy</h1>

  <h2>Size</h2>

  <p class=MsoNormal>The females usually measure 162–205cm (64–81in)
  in length and weigh 80–120kg (180–260<span class=SpellE>lb</span>).
  The males (or &quot;bulls&quot;) are typically larger (to an extent which
  varies between the different subspecies), measuring 180–214cm
  (71–84in) in length and usually weighing 159–182kg (351–401<span
  class=SpellE>lb</span>). Exceptionally large males have weighed as much as
  318kg (701<span class=SpellE>lb</span>). Weight varies drastically
  seasonally with males losing as much as 40% of their pre-rut weight.</p>

  <h2>Antlers</h2>

  <p class=MsoNormal>In most populations both sexes growantlers; the
  reindeer is the only<span class=SpellE>cervid</span>species in
  which females grow them as well as males.</p>

  <h2>Pelt</h2>

  <p class=MsoNormal>The color of thefurvaries considerably, both
  between individuals and depending on season and subspecies. Northern
  populations, which usually are relatively small, are whiter, while southern
  populations, which typically are relatively large, are darker.</p>

  <h2>Hooves</h2>

  <p class=MsoNormal>The reindeer has large feet with crescent-shaped, cloven hooves
  for walking in snow or swamps.</p>

  <h2>Breathing</h2>

  <p class=MsoNormal>Reindeer respiration occurs in the animal’s respiratory
  system. A respiratory system is made up of muscles, airways, and lungs that
  work to bring fresh air into lungs where oxygen is exchanged in blood for
  carbon dioxide.</p>

  <h2>Clicking Sound</h2>

  <p class=MsoNormal>The knees of many species of reindeer are adapted to produce
  a clicking sound as they walk. The sounds originate in the tendons of the knees
  and may be audible from ten meters away. The frequency of the knee-clicks is
  one of a range of signals that establish relative positions on a dominance
  scale among reindeer.</p>
